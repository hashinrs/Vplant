# VPlant - Vertical Farming Recommendation System

## Abstract

As the global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the scarcity of arable land due to increased urbanization, changing climate conditions, and soil contamination poses a significant challenge to food production. Vertical farming emerges as a sustainable solution by enabling indoor cultivation in controlled environments, thus removing the dependency on seasons and external environment conditions, allowing for year-round production. However, the steep learning curve associated with vertical farming presents a hurdle for entry-level or novice farmers with no prior knowledge of farming. VPlant is developed as a recommendation system to guide novice farmers by providing step-by-step recommendations throughout the vertical farming processes, from seeding to harvest. Utilizing Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) workflows, VPlant offers recommendations on nutrient levels in water, water cycling for plants, temperature maintenance in the grow environment, and disease prevention, detection, and eradication. VPlant aims to simplify the learning process of vertical farming for new farmers, contributing to the global aim of enhancing food supply sustainability.

## Features

- Guided BPMN workflows for various stages of crop growth.
- Recommendations for optimal nutrient levels, water cycles, temperature settings, and disease management.
- User-friendly interface designed for novice farmers.
- Supports BMPN files for customizable farming protocols.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library), install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install Pillow

## Setup and Running
1. Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system.
2. Install Pillow if it's not already installed
3. Download Vplant.py
4. Download .bpmn files 


## How to Use
1. Load BPMN File: Click on the "Load BPMN File" button to select a BPMN file containing the vertical farming process.
2. Navigate Through Steps: Use the "Next Step" button to proceed through each step of the farming process. Follow the recommendations provided for each step.
3. View Images and Alerts: When applicable, view images and alerts for specific steps to better understand the task at hand.
4. Closing: Use the "Close VPlant" button to exit the application.
